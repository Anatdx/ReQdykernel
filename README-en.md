# This is a personally modified version of the qiudaoyu kernel.
## Since the original qiudaoyu kernel was built using non-open-source tools and encrypted the kernel image for so-called “anti-resale” purposes,
## requiring users to execute suspicious programs with root privileges on their devices, and bundling those programs into the AK3 package,
## the author considers this behavior unfriendly. Therefore, this modified version replaces all suspicious programs and encrypted components.

## Only tested on the OnePlus Ace 5 Ultra; functionality on other devices is not guaranteed.

### Due to the author's poor mental state, updates may be delayed. Please understand.

## ✨ How to use the Workflow cloud-build script
